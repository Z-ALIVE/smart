This codebase is created solely for my previous work at Smart Communications Inc. a telecommunications company in the Philippines, I did not have a documented output of this code as I am no longer affiliated with Smart. But what this code does is to get the vm details/parametes like SN,Hostname,IP,Host Mapping, etc. The vm parametes are pooled via REST API using python in Huawei NMS called eSight.
